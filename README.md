#  Coding Practice

## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository contains a collection of foundational Java coding exercises aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills for freshers. These exercises were provided by my senior, **[Rohan Sakhare](https://github.com/rohsak5649)** -> [Link](https://rohsak5649.github.io/Interview-Experience-hub-/experience/basics.html), and cover a range of topics including basic arithmetic, geometry, string manipulation, and more. They are ideal for building a strong base in Java programming and preparing for technical interviews.
